# Welcome to the Dupond Showcase

> Wait... I know you.

'Monsieur Dupond' is a YouTube channel with 0 videos, 0 posts but infinite wholesomeness. He is famous in the Elder Scrolls community for commenting daily on [The Elder Scrolls VI â€“ Official Announcement Teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkFdqqyI8y4). His comments are in the form of *journal entries*, which catalogue his life, thoughts and opinions - not all related to the video itself.

> You wear the garb of a true Nord. I salute you.

I am just another Elder Scroll fanatic, stuck in the waiting lobby alongside countless others for 4 years now. Like so many in the community, I have rewatched the ES:VI announcement trailer - and every time I do so, I feel a bit excited to read the latest developments in our Monsieur's life. He is a **beacon** - not Meridia's, but one of hope and joy.

So this is it. My tribute, my salute to this amazing guy who has written tirelessly every single day for 1127 days as of writing this. You rock, Monsieur.

> No lollygagging.

This is just a fun side project I'm working on, and is absolutely free with no ads. I love contributing to communities I'm part of, so think of this as my way of documenting an immportant part of ES:VI history. No matter when it may release (probably 3025 at this rate), we must never forget this legend.
